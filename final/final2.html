                <h2>Nuclear Fission and Fusion</h2>
                <p>Nuclear energy relies on two primary nuclear reactions: fission and fusion.</p>

                <h3 id="fission">Nuclear Fission</h3>
                <p>Nuclear fission is the process where the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei), often producing free neutrons and photons (in the form of gamma rays), and releasing a very large amount of energy. This process is used in nuclear power plants to generate electricity. A common fuel for nuclear fission is Uranium-235.</p>
                <p>The chain reaction of fission sustains the energy production in a reactor. Control rods are used to absorb neutrons and regulate the rate of fission.</p>

                <h3>Nuclear Fusion</h3>
                <p>Nuclear fusion is the process where two or more atomic nuclei combine to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of energy. This mass difference arises due to the difference in nuclear binding energy between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers the sun and other stars.</p>
                <p>While fusion holds immense potential as a clean and abundant energy source, achieving sustained and controlled fusion on Earth is a significant technological challenge. Research efforts are ongoing around the world.</p>

                <h3>Reactor Technologies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR):</b> Use high-pressure water as both coolant and moderator.</li>
                    <li><b>Boiling Water Reactors (BWR):</b> Water is allowed to boil in the reactor core, and the steam directly drives turbines.</li>
                    <li><b>CANDU Reactors:</b> Canadian Deuterium Uranium reactors use natural uranium and heavy water as a moderator.</li>
                    <li><b>Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):</b> Smaller, more flexible reactors that can be deployed in various locations.</li>
                    <li><b>Fast Breeder Reactors (FBR):</b> Can breed more fissile material than they consume.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Radioactivity:</b> The phenomenon whereby unstable atomic nuclei spontaneously decay, emitting radiation.</li>
                    <li><b>Isotopes:</b> Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons.</li>
                    <li><b>Critical Mass:</b> The minimum amount of fissile material needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction.</li>
                    <li><b>Moderator:</b> A material used in a nuclear reactor to slow down fast neutrons, increasing the probability of fission.</li>
                    <li><b>Control Rods:</b> Rods made of neutron-absorbing material used to control the rate of fission in a reactor.</li>
